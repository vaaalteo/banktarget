  - '1) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings (AME) refers to all remuneration received
    before deduction of the employee Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions and
    personal income tax. It comprises basic wages, overtime pay, commissions, allowances
    and bonuses but exclude employer CPF contributions.'
  - '2) Data cover full-time and part-time employees who have CPF contributions. They
    exclude identifiable self-employed persons who have made CPF contribution.'
  - '3) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings covers employees who contribute to the Central
    Provident Fund. Available quarterly, AME provides a timely rough gauge of average
    wage movement. However, the AME can be influenced by the changing mix of full-time
    and part-time workers and variations in overtime as the data are compiled based
    on the payroll of contributors to the CPF which do not allow for breakdown separately
    to full-timers and part-timers. Also, as AME pertains to mean earnings, it can
    be skewed upwards by a small number of very high income earners. For income of
    a typical worker, users should refer to the median Gross Monthly Income From Work
    and for wage growth of employees over a year they can refer to the Annual Wage
    Changes, both of which are available on MOM’s website.'
